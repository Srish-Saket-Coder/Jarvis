 *******************************

Dear LDH,

I am writing to request a waiver of my current LDH debt. I am currently having a difficult time financially due to job loss, and am unable to meet my obligations at this time.

I am hoping you will be able to review my situation fairly and come to an amicable agreement. I am willing to discuss payment arrangements that can fit my current circumstances. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
